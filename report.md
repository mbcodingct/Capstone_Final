## Introduction
Disease of the heart is considered the highest reason of death worldwide. One of the most frequent ways it can cause death is for the heart disease to cause a heart failure event. During this project, I will try to use historical data to build a machine learning model to predict whether a patient to experience death by a heart failure based on medical checks data and lifestyle habits. This can allow doctors to intervene and apply necessary measures to change the outcome for that patient.

 

## Data
To build a machine learning model, I will use a dataset from the website kaggle.com. The url for the data is: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data. The data contains the following columns:
 

|Column|Description|

|-|-|

|Age| A numerical value for the age of test subject|

|Anaemia| A boolean value for whether the test subject has anameia|

|Creatinine Phosphokinase| The content of an enzyme that can indicate heart muscle damage|

|Diabetes|A boolean value for whether the test subject has diabetes|

|Ejection Fraction|Fraction of blood ejected from the left ventricle of the heart with each pump. It can be used to indicate heart failure or the severity of it|

|High Blood Pressure|A boolean value for whether the test subject has high blood pressure|

|Platelets|Platelet concentration in the blood measured in quantity per cubic millimeter|

|Serum Creatinine|Numerical value of creatinine in the blood serum. Indicator of kidney function|

|Serum Sodium|Numerical value of sodium in blood serum. |

|Sex| A boolean value, 0 for women, and 1 for men|

|Smoking|A boolean value for whether the test subject smokes|

|Time|The number of days between administring the tests and the follow up appointment and the determination of whether the patient has died or not|

|Death Event|A boolean value of whether the test subject has died after the medical tests|
